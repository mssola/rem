jQuery ->
  # Showing Facebook-like tips with jquery.tipsy
  $('.tip').tipsy { gravity: 'n' }

  # Let's apply some cool effects to Rails flash messages
  $('.flashy').hide()
  $('.flashy').delay(500).slideDown 'normal', ->
    $(this).show()
    $(this).delay(5000).slideUp('slow')

  # Here it goes the effect for the "span trick" applied to
  # some input widgets.
  holder = $(".span_trick").find("span")
  input = $(".span_trick").find("input:eq(0)")

  # If the span element is clicked, focus the input.
  holder.click ->
    input.focus()

  # Bind the focusout and the keydown events so the span element
  # is hidden when the user is writing something and this same
  # element gets visible when there's nothing on the input element.
  input.bind
    focusout: ->
      holder.show() if $(this).val() == ""

    keydown: ->
      holder.hide() if holder.is(":visible")
