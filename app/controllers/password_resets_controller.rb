# == PasswordResetsController Class Definition
#
# This is the password resets controller. It handles the logic behind
# resetting passwords. It sends an email when the user wants to reset his
# password. Inside this email, there are some instructions about how
# to properly reset the password and an url pointing to the edit method.
# In the edit page the user will be able to change his password.

  # The _create_ method. It's called when the user submitted the password
  # reset form. If everything is fine, it will send an email to the given
  # account with instructions inside on how to change his password and a link
  # pointing to the edit method.
