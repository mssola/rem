# == UserPresenter Class Definition
#
# This presenter connects the user model with the user account
# templates. It may sound weird since it's connecting two "different"
# things: the User and the Account. However, in my opinion the account
# is very related to the user so this kind of connection makes sense.
class UserPresenter < BasePresenter
  presents :user
  delegate :name, to: :user

  ##
  # Show how long this user is registered on our website.
  def member_since
    user.created_at.strftime("%e %B %Y")
  end
