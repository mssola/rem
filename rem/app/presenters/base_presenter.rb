# == BasePresenter Class Definition
#
# The Base class for all the presenters that may be implemented. It's
# as general as possible. On your presenter you can happily call template
# methods since this class implements the method_missing method to do
# so.
class BasePresenter
  ##
  # Constructor. It initializes its attributes so it can connect
  # the model with the template object.
  #
  # @param *Object* object A model that we want to present.
  #
  # @param *ActionView::Helper* template The template object.
  def initialize(object, template)
    @object, @template = object, template
  end

  private

  ##
  # Auxiliar class method that dynamically defines a getter for the
  # object type we are presenting. You should call this method at the
  # beginning of a subclass of this class.
  #
  # @param *Symbol* name The name of the object this presenter is presenting.
  def self.presents(name)
    define_method(name) { @object }
  end

  ##
  # Re-implementing the method_missing method. With this, this class will
  # bypass any unknown call to the template object. This is perfect if we
  # want to call template methods directly.
  #
  # @param *Variable Argument List* args The arguments to the missing method.
  #
  # @param *Block* block The block given to the missing method.
  def method_missing(*args, &block)
    @template.send(*args, &block)
