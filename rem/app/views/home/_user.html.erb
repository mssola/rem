<% title 'Home' %>

<p>Hi <b><%= current_user.name %></b>, this is your home page</p>

<br>
Before this webpage really takes off, we have to deal what it's capable of.
Right now, it should somehow show a map from Google showing your location.
<br>

<br>
You can <%= link_to 'create a new route', new_route_path %>
<br>
You can <%= link_to 'create a new place', new_place_path %>
<br>
This are your routes:
<% @routes = Route.find :all, :conditions => ['user_id=?', current_user.id] %>
<% @routes.each do |r| %>
  <%= link_to r.name, edit_route_path(r.id) %>
<% end %>
