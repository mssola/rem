# == UsersController Class Definition
#
# The controller for the users. It can create new users through the Sign Up
# form. It can edit users through de dashboard and show users through the
# Rest API. A user can also delete his account so this controller must
# handle the destroy method too.
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  # This class responds to Ajax requests.

  # The _new_ method. It corresponds to the signup page. It initializes
  # an empty user.

  # on the signup page. It creates this new user with the given parameters
  # available on the signup form. If everything is fine, it redirects the
  # user to his home page.
