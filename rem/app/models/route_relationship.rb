# == RouteRelationship Class Definition
#
# This is a model that defines the relationship between a user and a route.
# The point is that a user can follow multiple routes and unfollow other ones
# later on. It's clearly inspired on the Relationship model.
class RouteRelationship < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :followed_id

  # A RouteRelationship is about a User that follows a Route.
  belongs_to :follower, class_name: 'User'
  belongs_to :followed, class_name: 'Route'

  validates_presence_of :followed_id, :follower_id
