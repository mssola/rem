# == Relationship Class Definition
#
# This is a model that allows users to track who is following who.
# It's used by the User model in a has_many-through relationship. In the
# database it's stored the follower id and the followed id. Due its
# simetry, you can also do the same but backwards. This property is used
# by the User model in order to implement an optimal DB access.
class Relationship < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :followed_id

  # A relationship is a matter of two users: the follower and the followed
  belongs_to :follower, class_name: 'User'
  belongs_to :followed, class_name: 'User'

  validates_presence_of :followed_id, :follower_id
