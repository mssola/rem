# == Place Class Definition
#
# This is the model that represents a place. It belongs to a route. It
# may have a name, a description, etc. but most importantly, this model
# is the one that will be gmapable. Therefore, it needs attributes such as
# longitude, latitude and address.

  validates_uniqueness_of :name, :scope => :route_id
