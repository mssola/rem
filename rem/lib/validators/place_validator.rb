# == PlaceValidator Class Definition
#
# This is the validator for the Place model. The validation consists
# in check if the name is nil or if the address was given. It's considered
# the address to be given either when the attribute address was given or
# the latitude and longitude were given.
class PlaceValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
  ##
  # Re-implement the validate method to perform this special validation.
  #
  # @param *Place* record The place that we have to validate.
  def validate(record)
    if record.name.nil?
      record.errors[:base] << 'You have to provide a name for this place'
    elsif record.route_id.nil?
      record.errors[:base] << 'You have to provide a route_id for this place'
    elsif !address_given?(record)
      record.errors[:base] << 'You have to provide an address for this place'
    end
