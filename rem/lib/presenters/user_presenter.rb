# == UserPresenter Class Definition
#
# This presenter connects the user model with the user account
# templates. It may sound weird since it's connecting two "different"
# things: the User and the Account. However, in my opinion the account
# is very related to the user so this kind of connection makes sense.
class UserPresenter < BasePresenter
  presents :user
  delegate :name, :email, :full_name, :location, to: :user
