module Hermes #:nodoc:
  ##
  # This module defines different and plausible ways to handle
  # Ajax responses. The idea is that this module is mixed-in the
  # AjaxRequest module so it learns how to set a proper response
  # to a given request.
  module AjaxResponse
    ##
    # *Hash* This is the attribute that contains a response. It contains
    # two items: value and dest.
    # - The _value_ field is where the response string is stored.
    # - The _dest_ field contains the destination of the response.
    attr_accessor :ajax_response

    ##
    # Initialize the ajax_response attribute.
    #
    # @param *String* dest The response destination.
    def init_response(dest)
      @ajax_response = { value: '', dest: dest }
    end

    ##
    # Sets the default uniqueness response with a given attribute.
    #
    # @param *String* attribute The involved attribute.
    def set_uniqueness_response(attribute)
      @ajax_response[:value] = "Sorry but this #{attribute} is not available!"

    # Clears the ajax response attribute.
