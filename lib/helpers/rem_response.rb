# == RemResponse Module Definition
#
# This module is the responsible to return a proper response that will
# be sent as an XML or JSON object. Therefore, this module is only usable
# for calls sent via the Rest API.
module RemResponse
  ##
  # Create a response for the 200 http response (Ok)
  #
  # @param *Hash* opts Some additional rows.
  #
  # @return *Hash* the response for this situation. Only the _status_ field
  # is mandatory although the server may set up some other fields with
  # the given parameter _opts_.
  def rem_ok(opts = {})
    { status: 200 }.merge!(opts)
  end

  ##
  # Create a response for the 201 http response (Created).
  #
  # @param *ActiveRecord::Base* row This is the row we've created. It assumes
  # that it responds to the _name_, _created_at_ and _id_ methods.
  #
  # @return *Hash* the response for this situation. This hash has the
  # following fields: _status_, _msg_, _id_, _name_ and _created_at_.

  ##
  # Create a response for a given error that we're facing.
  #
  # @param *Integer* status The HTTP status code.
  #
  # @return *Hash* the response for this situation, with just two fields:
  # _status_ (http status code) and _msg_ (some info about the error).
