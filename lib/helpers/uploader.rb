# == Uploader Module Definition
#
# This module is the responsible to upload photos and also to remove photos.
# When a photo is uploaded, it also creates a place with the attributes
# setted as expected. When we want to remove a photo, it also destroys the
# place containing it.
#
# Be aware that this module is expected to be mixed in a controller. This is
# because it needs to access to the params hash among other things.
module Uploader
  ##
  # To help on building the response hash.
  include RemResponse

  ##
  # Constant containing the base directory for the uploads.
  BASE = 'app/uploads'

  ##
  # This method handles the upload of a photo. In order to work properly,
  # we should have a current user authenticated and the params must be setted
  # accordingly. If the current user is not authenticated, it will just
  # return a 401 (Unauthorized) http response. It will return a 404 (Not found)
  # http response if the parameters passed are incorrect
  # (see Uploader#incorrect_params?). Moreover, it will return a 409 (Conflict)
  # http response if the given name (taking into account its full path) already
  # exists.
  #
  # If everything else is fine, we will get as a response a 201 (Created)
  # http response. It means that a place has been created in the database and
  # that the photo has been successfully stored in the server.
  #
  # @return *Array* a two-sized array. The first element is a *Hash* containing
  # at least the field _msg_ where it's stored a description of what happened.
  # The last element is an *Integer* that represents the HTTP response status.

  # We consider that this file does not exist yet, so if this is not the case,

  # status). Otherwise, it will create this file and all the directories if
  # necessary.

  # @param *String* route The route id.

  # containing the path of this file otherwise.
